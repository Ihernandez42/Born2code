[![ismherna 42 stats](https://badge.mediaplus.ma/Darkblue/ismherna?1337Badge=off&UM6P=off)](https://github.com/oakoudad/badge42)


In this repository, 42 projects will be uploaded when they have been delivered, corrected and well studied. This is my academic tour of the 42 Madrid programming school, which will consist of the mandatory part "Common core" and the future specialization branches "Outher core" organized by ranks.

# Common core

The common core of school 42 constitutes the elementary learning about programming that every student must acquire, it is organized around 6 rings from the initial project, from rank 0 to rank 6, from the second ring the student must not only face projects but to exams that will allow you to access higher levels.

After the common core by passing ft_transcendence project and the Exam Rank 06, the student has access as a "member" to the Outer Core, which is made up of a series of branches that represent the specialties: cybersecurity, algorithms and data, gaming, devops, etc.
